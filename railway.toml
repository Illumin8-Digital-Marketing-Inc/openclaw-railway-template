# Gerald Railway Template
# 
# CRITICAL: You MUST add a persistent volume to preserve configuration between deployments
# 
# To add a volume in Railway:
# 1. Go to your service → Settings → Volumes
# 2. Click "New Volume"
# 3. Mount Path: /data
# 4. Size: 1GB (minimum)
# 
# Without a volume, you'll lose all configuration on every deploy!
